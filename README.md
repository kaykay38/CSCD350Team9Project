# Aircraft Navaid Simmulation

This project utilizes the jar library to implement some basic navaid functions in aircraft navigation. The main objective of this project was to implement software to client specifications and use the Agile development process. My teammates and I had multiple meetings a week to plan, design, implement, evaluate the project to specifications. There were regular check-ins with our client to be sure we understood the requirements and were on the righ track.
